Be careful to have right format of points (list of lists, where sublists are xyz coordinates of points)

Be careful that order of magnitude is 1. I.e. points are ideally in a 1x1x1 cell, but any axbxc cell is okay as long as a, b and c are in the order of 1. Otherwise it will very easily come to rounding errors, as margins of error are often hardcoded.
